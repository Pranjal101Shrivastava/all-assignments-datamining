AutoGluon is an open-source AutoML library that automatically cleans data, engineers features, selects and tunes models, and even blends them — all with just a few lines of code.
I worked on five different notebooks: IEEE Fraud Detection, California Housing Regression, Advertising Regression, Multi-model training on the Diabetes dataset, and Automatic Feature Engineering on the Heart Disease dataset.”
